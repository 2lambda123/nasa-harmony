These data are provided in a single data file in netCDF format, and can be used for analysis for ocean, ice, and hydrology phenomena. This version of the data employs a Coastal Resolution Improvement (CRI) filter that reduces signal leakage errors across coastlines. The water storage/height anomalies are given in equivalent water thickness units (cm). The solution provided here is derived from solving for monthly gravity field variations in terms of geolocated spherical cap mass concentration functions, rather than global spherical harmonic coefficients. Additionally, realistic geophysical information is introduced during the solution inversion to intrinsically remove correlated error. Thus, these Mascon grids do not need to be destriped or smoothed, like traditional spherical harmonic gravity solutions. The complete Mascon solution consists of 4,551 relatively independent estimates of surface mass change that have been derived using an equal-area 3-degree grid of individual mascons. A subset of these individual mascons span coastlines, and contain mixed land and ocean mass change signals. In a post-processing step, the CRI filter is applied to those mixed land/ocean Mascons to separate land and ocean mass. The land mask used to perform this separation is provided in the same directory as this dataset. Since the individual mascons act as an inherent smoother on the gravity field, a set of optional gain factors (for continental hydrology applications) that can be applied to the solution to study mass change signals at sub-mascon resolution is also provided within the same data directory as the Mascon data. Please refer to the 'Data Access' tab at the top of this page to gain direct access to the Mascon data.

Enhancements with this release include:  use of an improved 0.125 degree land correction table with land emission based on SMAP TB; replacement of the previous NCEP sea-ice mask with one based on RSS AMSR-2 and implementing a sea-ice threshold of 0.3% (gain weighted sea-ice fraction); revised solar flagging that depends on glint angle and wind speed; inclusion of estimated SSS-uncertainty; consolidation of both 40KM and 70KM SMAP-SSS datasets as variable fields  in a single data product. Daily data files for this product are based on SSS averages spanning an 8-day moving time window.  SMAP data begins on April 1,2015 and is ongoing. L3 products are global in extent and gridded at 0.25degree x 0.25degree with a default spatial feature resolution of approximately 70KM. Note that while a SSS 40KM variable is also included in the product, for most open ocean applications, the  default SSS variable (70KM) is best used as they are significantly less noisy than the 40KM data.  The SMAP satellite is in a near-polar orbit at an inclination of 98 degrees and an altitude of 685 km. It has an ascending node time of 6 pm and is sun-synchronous. With its 1000km swath, SMAP achieves global coverage in approximately 3 days, but has an exact orbit repeat cycle of 8 days.  On board instruments include a highly sensitive L-band radiometer operating at 1.41GHz and an L-band 1.26GHz radar sensor providing complementary active and passive sensing capabilities.  Malfunction of the SMAP scatterometer on 7 July, 2015, has necessitated the use of collocated wind speed, primarily from WindSat, for the surface roughness correction required for the surface salinity retrieval.","service_features":{"harmony":{"has_formats":true,"has_variables":false,"has_transforms":false,"has_spatial_subsetting":false,"has_temporal_subsetting":false},"opendap":{"has_formats":false,"has_variables":false,"has_transforms":false,"has_spatial_subsetting":false,"has_temporal_subsetting":false},"esi":{"has_formats":false,"has_variables":false,"has_transforms":false,"has_spatial_subsetting":false,"has_temporal_subsetting":false}},"orbit_parameters":{},"id":"C1234410736-POCLOUD","has_formats":true,"original_format":"UMM_JSON","archive_center":"NASA/JPL/PODAAC","has_temporal_subsetting":false,"browse_flag":true,"platforms":["SMAP"],"online_access_flag":true,"links":[{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://www.remss.com/missions/smap"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/allData/smap/sw/matlab/"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/allData/smap/sw/r/"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://images.remss.com/figures/missions/smap/bad_ancillaries.txt"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/browse#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/Podaac/thumbnails/SMAP_RSS_L3_SSS_SMI_8DAY-RUNNINGMEAN_V4.jpg"},{"length":"0.0KB","rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://thredds.jpl.nasa.gov/thredds/catalog/ncml_aggregation/SalinityDensity/smap/catalog.html?dataset=ncml_aggregation/SalinityDensity/smap/aggregate__SMAP_RSS_L3_SSS_SMI_8DAY-RUNNINGMEAN_V4.ncml"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/allData/smap/docs/V4/RSS_SMAP-SSS_V4.0_TechnicalDocumentation.pdf"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/las"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://images.remss.com/figures/missions/smap/bad_orbits.txt"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/allData/smap/README.KnownIssues.txt"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/smap"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/allData/smap/sw/idl/"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/allData/smap/docs/V4/"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/allData/smap/L3/RSS/README.txt"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/service#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://podaac-opendap.jpl.nasa.gov/opendap/allData/smap/L3/RSS/V4/8day_running/SCI/"},{"length":"0.0KB","rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/allData/smap/L3/RSS/V4/8day_running/SCI"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC"},{"length":"0MB","rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/virtual-directory/collections/C1940468263-POCLOUD"},{"length":"0MB","rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/granules?p=C1940468263-POCLOUD"}]}]}}
