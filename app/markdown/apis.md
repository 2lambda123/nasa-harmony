## Using the APIs
This section provides an introduction to the Harmony APIs. For a full description see the [API Documentation](/docs/api).

Each API requires a CMR collection concept ID with which transformations can be performed using

{{root}}/{collectionId}/ogc-api-coverages/1.0.0

for OGC or

 {{root}}/{collectionId}/wms for WMS.
